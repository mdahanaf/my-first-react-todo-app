**My Super Simple React Todo App!**

**What I used:**
- React JS.
- Hooks (I used useState and useRef).
- CSS inside of JS (To make the delete button look red & green).


**What I learned:**
- How to handle forms without the page refreshing (that e.preventDefault()).
- How to map through arrays to show a list.

Thanks.
